Project Title: Government Employee Attendance Management System
(Phase-1 Prototype – E-Governance Style)

I want you to build a simple but functional full-stack web application as a Phase-1 prototype of a Government Employee Attendance Management System intended for use in Nepali government offices.

This system represents a manual-to-digital transition model, where employees mark attendance through a secure web portal, and an admin verifies attendance records.

Tech Stack:

Backend: Django + Django REST Framework

Frontend: React

Database: SQLite (prototype use)

Styling: Bootstrap (government portal style)

UI / Design Guidelines:

Government-style layout similar to Nepali e-governance portals

Header text:
“Government of Nepal”
“Ministry of Federal Affairs & General Administration”

Formal color scheme:

Dark blue / maroon / white / gray

Simple typography (official look)

Footer text:

“© Government of Nepal – Attendance Management System (Prototype)”

Use free, royalty-free images related to:

Government offices

Public service

Office environments

Project Objective:

Develop a working prototype that demonstrates:

Digital attendance marking by employees

Administrative verification of attendance

Advanced features such as biometric authentication, GPS tracking, face recognition, and RFID must NOT be implemented and should be clearly mentioned as future enhancements.

User Roles:

Logs in using username (employee ID style)
